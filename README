DESCRIPTION
    This dancer plugin gives you access to the account and cart functions of
    the Nitesi shop machine.

CARTS
    The cart keyword returns a Nitesi::Cart object with the corresponding
    methods.

    You can use multiple carts like that:

        cart('wishlist')->add({sku => 'ABC', name => 'Foobar', quantity => 1, price => 42});
        cart('wishlist')->total;

    The DBI backend (Dancer::Plugin::Nitesi::Cart::DBI) allows you to load
    carts of arbitrary users.

        cart('', 123)->items;

ACCOUNTS
    The account keyword returns a Nitesi::Account::Manager object with the
    corresponding methods.

    Login to an account:

        account->login(username => 'frank@nitesi.com', password => 'nevairbe');

    Logout:

        account->logout();

    Check permissions:

        account->acl(check => 'view_prices');

    Change password for current account:

        account->password('nevairbe');

    Change password for other account:

        account->password(username => 'frank@nitesi.com', password => 'nevairbe');

    Create account:

        account->create(email => 'fina@nitesi.com');
